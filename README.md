## FAQs
* **Why is my IBAN not working?**<br>
A typical QR bill ([example](https://github.com/sprain/php-swiss-qr-bill/blob/master/example/example.php)) requires a special QR IBAN. You can get yours from your bank. A classic IBAN can be used for QR bills with a SCOR reference ([example](https://github.com/sprain/php-swiss-qr-bill/blob/master/example/example_scor.php)) or no reference number at all ([example](https://github.com/sprain/php-swiss-qr-bill/blob/master/example/example_minimal.php)).

* **How do I recognize a QR IBAN?**<br>
In a QR IBAN, the *institute id*, which is defined in the 5th to 9th character, is a number in the range of 30000 to 31999. (Example: CH44 **3199 9**123 0008 8901 2). For how to detect it in code, see https://github.com/sprain/php-swiss-qr-bill/issues/182#issuecomment-1229539977

* **How do I create QR bills for international IBANs?**<br>
You can't. The QR bill by specification only supports IBANs from Switzerland and Liechtenstein.

* **How do I support currencies other than CHF or EUR?**<br>
You can't. The QR bill by specification only supports CHF and EUR.

* **How do I change translations to use my own wording?**<br>
You can't. The translations are defined in the QR bill specification and are not meant to be changed by the user. See [this document](https://github.com/sprain/php-swiss-qr-bill/blob/master/docs/specs/style-guide-en.pdf), page 31.

* **How do I make my QR bills payable by Twint?**<br>
See https://github.com/sprain/php-swiss-qr-bill/issues/129 

* **What PDF libraries are supported by this library?**<br>
The following libraries are currently actively supported:
  * [fpdf/fpdf](https://packagist.org/packages/fpdf/fpdf)
  * [tecnickcom/tcpdf](https://packagist.org/packages/tecnickcom/tcpdf)
  * [setasign/fpdi](https://packagist.org/packages/setasign/fpdi) (accepted by `FpdfOutput` and `TcPdfOutput`)

  The output of `HtmlOutput` is known to be used to generate PDFs with [PrinceXML](https://www.princexml.com), [Docraptor](http://docraptor.com), and [dompdf/dompdf](https://packagist.org/packages/dompdf/dompdf) (with some adjustments as decribed [here](https://github.com/sprain/php-swiss-qr-bill/issues/178#issuecomment-1222752493))

* **Why are you using `final` on most classes? I want to extend them!**<br>
This library implements the official specification of the QR bill. This implementation is not supposed to be adjusted as it might result in broken QR bills. Therefore many classes are marked as final. If you find the need to extend one of those final classes, you might have found a bug in this library. In that case it will be very helpful if you provide a bug report or even a pull request here. Thank you!
